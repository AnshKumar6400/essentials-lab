Perfect â€” here's how to do the exact same thing you did with a Linux EC2 instance, but using a Windows EC2 instead.

ðŸŽ¯ Scenario:
You're setting up a Windows EC2 instance with:

Same VPC, CIDR, and key pair

Same security group setup

Same purpose (e.g., auto-installing a web server like IIS)

âœ… Step-by-Step: Same Setup Using a Windows AMI
1. Launch EC2 Instance
Go to EC2 > Launch Instance

Choose Windows Server 2019/2022 Base AMI

Select the same VPC and subnet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24)

Choose the same .pem key pair

2. Use This PowerShell Script in User Data
Under Advanced > User Data, paste:
<powershell>
# Install IIS (Windows Web Server)
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server
# Optional: Create a test HTML page
New-Item -Path "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.html" -ItemType "File" -Value "<h1>Hello from Windows EC2</h1>"
# Start the IIS service
Start-Service W3SVC
</powershell>
3. Security Group Settings (Same as Before)
Make sure the security group has:

âœ… Port 3389 (RDP) â€“ to connect to Windows

âœ… Port 80 (HTTP) â€“ if youâ€™re setting up a web server

4. Connect to the Instance
After instance is running:

Click "Connect" > RDP Client > Get Password

Upload your .pem file

Copy the Administrator password

Use Remote Desktop (RDP):

Host: public IP

User: Administrator

Password: <decrypted>

5. Verify IIS is Running
Open your browser and go to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://<EC2 Public IP>/
You should see:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Hello from Windows EC2
âœ… Done!
Youâ€™ve now done exactly the same setup on a Windows instance:

Same VPC, subnet, key pair

Script runs automatically

IIS or any Windows service is installed

Let me know if you want to set up more advanced stuff like:

Running .exe installers from S3

Setting custom hostname

Installing Node.js or Python on Windows
